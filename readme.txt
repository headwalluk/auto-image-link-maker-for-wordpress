Automatically wraps unwrapped images in clickable anchor links and opens them in a lightbox.

== Description ==

Auto Image Link Maker scans your pages for images that are not already inside a link and wraps them in anchor tags. Clicked images open in a smooth, touch-friendly lightbox powered by GLightbox.

This is especially useful for content with HTML tables (from the WordPress block editor) where images are not always clickable.

**Features:**

* Configurable CSS selectors to target specific images
* Choose which page types to enable (posts, pages, archives, front page, etc.)
* Built-in GLightbox lightbox for smooth image viewing
* No jQuery dependency
* Lightweight and non-destructive — stored content is never modified
* Translations included for de_DE, el_GR, en_GB, es_ES, fr_FR, it_IT, nl_NL, pl_PL (machine-translated — human review welcome)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `auto-image-link-maker` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings > Image Link Maker to configure CSS selectors and page types.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which images are affected? =
